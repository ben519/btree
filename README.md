# btree
binary tree structures as data.table objects

About
------
The goals of this package are:

- Easy generation binary tree structures as data.table objects
- Measure binary tree structure properties (e.g. height, path to node, ...)
- Easy plotting of binary trees

The original intent of the package was to make it easy to standardize and analze the tree structures generated by various 
tree-based machine learning models in R.


Installation
------

#### Github (development version)
```r
install.packages("devtools")

library(devtools)
install_github("ben519/btree")
```

## What is a btree?

For our purposes, it's a data.table with the following structure:

- Each row represents a node in the tree and is uniquely identified by NodeID
- Each row contains a ParentNodeID which points at the node's parent. (The root node has ParentID = NA)

Using the `make_btree(...)` constructor generates a data.table with additional properties. Namely:

- Each row contains a IsLeaf attribute indicating if the node is a leaf
- Each row contains a LeftChildID and RightChildID (NA for leaf nodes)
- Each row contains a Path attribute which is a string of 0s and 1s representing the path from the root node to the given node.  E.g. "010" = root -> left child -> right child -> left child

## Decision Tree / Regression Tree

A btree can also be a decision tree / regression tree where:

- Each non-leaf node must contain a decision rule determining how to split the data
- Rules are represents by the attribute ConditionLeft, such that evaluating to TRUE sends a point to the left child node
- E.g. ConditionLeft could be "Petal.Length <= 2.35" or in the case of xgboost, "Petal.Length <= 2.35 | is.na(Petal.Length)"

library(btree)

make_btree(nodeIDs=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7), parentNodeIDs=c(NA,1,1,2,2,3,3))
